    <th>Notes</th>
    <td>1. Recommended to stick with the default "Asuka" for player character name.<br/>2. The demo is locked to Tenrin - the first region of the game.<br/>3. I won't be updating this demo patch, unless a major error is discovered.<br/>ã€€(I'd rather spend time working on the remaining untranslated areas instead of maintaining a demo)</td>
