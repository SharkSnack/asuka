Dungeon where you mainly use staves and scrolls to progress - weapons and shields are only sold in shops.<br/>Allies can be brought along, so the key is to support them using staves like Fury Staff and Swift Staff.

Powerful items like Extinction Scroll and Scout Bracelet can be found on the ground.<br/>However, you can't really upgrade a shield, so the difficulty is on the high end even with such items.<br/>That said, the first clear is only 17F, so you can easily clear it by leveling and supporting an ally.

The 99F version can be cleared without allies if you obtain an Ironhead's Head + Scout Bracelet,<br/>but you'll still need to have a good understanding of the available staves and scrolls.

### General

#### Story Clear (17F)

The easiest strategy is to bring 1 ally → hunt Iron Zaloklefts on 6\~8F to level up and obtain items.<br/>Storage Pots can be purchased after 5F in Ichido Village, and most players go with either Jin or Heiji.<br/>If you haven't unlocked allies in Yakagura Forest yet, check the [FAQ](/guides/faq) page.

#### Full Version (99F)

The lack of a shield means your run can easily end if you get surrounded from mid game onward.<br/>Simply becoming adjacent to an enemy can be dangerous, let alone starting a floor inside a Monster House.<br/>You'll want to pay close attention to your ally's positioning until you have a usable weapon.

Ironhead's Head can be used alongside Scout Bracelet and Vision Bracelet to solo the dungeon,<br/>so don't give up right away if your ally collapses due to an accident - linger until the wind blows on 20-22F<br/>to see if you can obtain an Ironhead's Head first (8.2% drop rate).

#### Drain Types

It's generally good to let your ally fight monsters, but you should never let them fight Sluggy or Slime types.<br/>Sluggy lowers attack, and Slime lowers defense - <span class="danger">both effects are permanent for the duration of this adventure.</span><br/>The lowered stats won't be restored even if you change floors, and Antidote Grass cannot be found in this dungeon.<br/>So, either throw an Extinction Scroll at them, or have Asuka take the hit for them.

※ Sludge inflicts Sealed status instead of lowering defense, so it's fine to let allies fight them.

#### Extinction Scroll

Good options include:

- Rancor Sluggy (24-30F)
- Grime (31-40F)
- Devil Kangaroo (41-50F, 61-70F)
- Ooze (46-55F)
- Venom Sluggy (56-70F)
- Porkon (61-75F)
- Mirage Devil (61-75F)
- Dozikon (76-90F)
- Astral Devil (76-99F)
- Archdragon (86-99F)

#### Shield

Ironhead's Head is two-handed, so you can't equip a shield if you use that weapon.<br/>This isn't a problem, since there are only 3 types of shields sold in shops, and they're all weak.

# Floor Guide

### 1-5F

Check every room and pick up all items - you shouldn't have problems if you bring an ally.<br/>Identify staves by using them on an ally or monster from at least 1 tile away in case it's a Lightning Staff.<br/>If you find a Happy Staff, save it for creating an Iron Zalokleft instead of creating a Cave Mamel.

Don't let Sluggy (4-5F) lick allies - Antidote Grass can't be found, so strength loss for allies is permanent.<br/>Asuka can recover strength using Decoy Bracelet or Fixer Scroll, so have her take the hit instead.

The ideal start if aiming for 99F is to find a Happy Staff, Sapping Branch (shop-exclusive),<br/>and enough items to sell to be able to buy items at the Ichido Village item shop.

### Ichido Village

Sell unneeded items and buy 5\~10 Storage Pots.<br/>If you're only aiming for the story clear, go ahead and buy lots of Navigation Scrolls.

##### Fixer Scroll Tip (Dreamcast)

If you read a Fixer Scroll inside the storage building when you have 0 Gitan, you'll gain 10,000 Gitan.<br/>※ PC version reduced it to 1,000 Gitan to prevent being able to shop infinitely.

#### Gambler

Pay 100 Gitan per play.

#### Item Shop

|Item|Price|
|-|-|
|Identify Scroll|500|
|Navigation Scroll|500|
|Blaze Scroll|1200|
|Fixer Scroll|1500|
|Swap Staff[5]|1000|
|Knockback Staff[5]|625|
|Transient Staff[5]|1500|
|Seal Staff[5]|2500|
|Huge Onigiri|300|
|Storage Pot[4]|1440|

### 6-11F

Zalokleft (6-8F) appears, so create an Iron Zalokleft for your ally to fight if you found a Happy Staff.<br/>Zaloklefts can't steal from allies, so step out of the room and let your ally handle the situation.<br/>The ideal result here in terms of item drops is at least 1 Scout Bracelet and 1 Vision Bracelet.<br/><span class="danger">※ Don't worry if you weren't able to find a Happy Staff for this - the dungeon can still be cleared.</span>

Combine staves using Thief Pelicans (7-10F) to free up inventory space, but beware of Crow Tengus on 7F.<br/>If you have lots of food, consider hunting Pud (9-10F) until the wind blows for Strength Seeds.

### Shimei Beach

The only facility here is a storage building where you can deposit items.

### 12-17F

Pumphantasm (11-13F) and Muron (14-16F) can cause you to become separated from your ally.<br/>Try to avoid having Mutaikon (12-14F) throw Poison Grass at allies - Heiji is fine, since he'll throw it back.

Robber Pelican (14-16F) overlaps with Falcon Tengu (15-16F), so check if it's real before synthesizing.<br/>Pop Tank (15-16F) and Horse Samurai (17-19F) can hit both you and your ally from a distance.

### Boss

Fight against Nemuri and her enamored monster followers.<br/>The fight begins with 9 other monsters on the field, including Dazikon, Horse Samurai, and Yenron.

|Name|HP|Atk|Def|Exp|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Nemuri|80|30|15|3000|・Doesn't move, but warps and summons 1 monster when hit.<br/>・Fires a long ranged 30 damage piercing laser when lined up.<br/>・Reflects magic, and is immune to status conditions.|

Nemuri only has 80 HP, but always fires a laser that deals 30 damage when you're lined up with her.<br/>She reflects staff magic, which can be used to your advantage to buff Asuka if desired.

An ally supported by staves like Swift, Rage, Heal, and Invisible can make quick work of enemies.<br/>If you're alone, use Lightning Staff, Lightning Scroll, and Rockfall Scroll to reduce the number of monsters.

Nemuri won't move unless she receives damage, so once you two are alone on the field, you can step in place<br/>to safely recover HP as much as you want between attacks as long as you avoid lining up with her.<br/>However, she can summon Tiny Phoenix, so expect her HP to be fully restored if that happens.

### 18-23F

Ironhead appears between 20-22F, so linger until the wind blows in search of an Ironhead's Head.<br/>Monster Staff, Mon House Scroll, and Monster Trap can be used to generate additional Ironheads.<br/>(Swinging a Happy Staff → Unlucky Staff is said to add an extra drop chance)

### 24-30F

Rancor Sluggy (24-30F) can multiply when hit, so either throw an Extinction Scroll or use Seal Staff.<br/>If you haven't found an Ironhead's Head yet, use Unlucky Staff on Chainhead (24-30F, 35-40F).

### 31-40F

Grime (31-40F) sharply lowers ally defense, so avoid having your ally fight them.<br/>Unequip items if they're not plated and have Asuka fight instead, or throw an Extinction Scroll.

### 41-55F

Devil Kangaroo (41-50F) isn't as common here compared to Kron Trial or Bufu Trial,<br/>so you can usually get by without having to throw an Extinction Scroll if you rush stairs.

Ooze (46-55F) reduces ally defense to 0 and can multiply when hit - consider throwing an Extinction Scroll.

Vexing Kappa (51-65F) can throw Extinction Scrolls found on the ground to one-shot you,<br/>so it's best to equip a Decoy Bracelet before stepping into rooms.

### 56-75F

Venom Sluggy (56-70F) is dangerous for both you and your ally, similar to Rancor Sluggy.<br/>
Tiger Chucker (56-65F, 81-90F) can separate you from your ally, so don't be stingy with Seal Staff.<br/>Devil Kangaroo (61-70F) returns, but has a low spawn rate like before.

Porkon (61-75F) deals massive damage thanks to the lack of a shield, so throw an Extinction Scroll.<br/>Invisible Mirage Devils (61-75F) hit hard and have tricky movement, so keep a Vision Bracelet equipped.<br/>They reflect staff magic, so use items like Fear Scroll (also affects allies) or Sanctuary Scroll instead.

### 76-99F

Dozikon (76-90F), Astral Devil (76-99F), and Archdragon (86-99F) are major threats.<br/>Recommended to throw an Extinction Scroll at Archdragon, or Astral Devil if you're out of Vision Bracelets.
