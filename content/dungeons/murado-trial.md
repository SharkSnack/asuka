# Strategy

### Dungeon Mechanics

#### RNG

Turn RNG is the same at the start, so the result will be identical if the same actions are taken.

#### Accuracy

All attacks including arrows and thrown items have 100% accuracy.<br/>
Spry Shield effectively lacks a special ability in this dungeon.

#### Damage

Damage dealt and received have zero variance, with 2 exceptions:

- Throwing a bracelet, scroll, or cursed item deals 1\~2 damage.
- Stepping on a Trip Stone deals 2\~4 damage.

#### Traps

Traps have a 100% activation rate when stepped on.<br/>They never break when triggered, except for Pitfall and Summon Trap.

#### Pitfalls

A character that falls into a Pitfall vanishes from the floor and is considered defeated.<br/>This applies to any character, including Asuka and Gold Mamels.<br/>The Pitfall always disappears after 1 activation.

#### Monster Behavior

Whether or not a monster uses its special attack is random. (100% if it has Enraged status)<br/>The direction an enemy proceeds in at a fork in a hallway is random, provided they haven't seen Asuka.

### Solutions

#### 1-20F
