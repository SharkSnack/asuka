First dungeon of the game if you're playing the Dreamcast version.<br/>
The dungeon is split into a number of areas, and there are a few overworld rest spots along the way.<br/>Thief Pelican (synthesis monster) appears later than in other dungeons, so defense may feel low early on.<br/>All items are found identified, negative effect items can't be found, and there's an easy boss fight at the end.

##### Seals

弟 seals should be synthesized into your shield before a weapon.<br/>The 回 seal (Healing Sword) is powerful, but isn't listed due to the difficulty of creating it.

# Floor Guide

### Izayoi Paddy (1-2F)

Monsters are weak, so you shouldn't have problems - check every room and pick up all items.<br/>Lady Locks (2-4F) reflects projectiles, so don't shoot arrows or throw items at her.

### Kodama Pass (3-4F)

Nigiri Novice (3-5F) has higher attack than other monsters, so be careful if you don't have a shield.

Sluggy (4-5F) can lower your strength by 1, which decreases the amount of damage you deal.<br/>It's best to use projectiles to defeat it or staves to disable it from a distance to avoid strength loss.<br/>If you found a Scale Shield, keep it equipped to block the strength lowering effect of its licks.<br/>That said, village shops have Antidote Grass for sale, so don't worry too much if you lose strength here.

### Matagi Village

If you haven't found better equipment yet, go ahead and buy a Nagamaki and Bronze Shield.<br/>Buy 1 Antidote Grass and 3\~4 Otogiriso for synthesis later in the dungeon, along with some food.<br/>Storage Pots are great for expanding inventory and protecting onigiri from spoiling, but are a bit expensive.<br/>If you don't think you can clear the dungeon in a single attempt, buy an Escape Scroll.

If you have some extra money, visit the Mon Box Shop and buy Bow Boy for 4000 Gitan.<br/>This Mon Box lets you stock up on Wood Arrows without having to rely on enemy Bow Boys or floor items.<br/>In fact, some players prioritize this Bow Boy Box, since the next village has similar or better items.

|Nagamaki|700|

### Tengu Windhole (5-6F)

Field of view is now limited in hallways, and hidden traps can be generated in the ground.<br/>Bow Boy (5-7F) shoots arrows from a distance, so use zigzag movement to get closer while avoiding arrows.<br/>If you encounter a Bow Boy that never shoots arrows, it's a Crow Tengu (5-7F) in disguise.

Gazer (6-8F) can hypnotize Asuka, making her use an item or attack in a random direction.<br/>Keep valuable or risky items such as Revival Grass or Escape Scroll in pots instead of carrying them openly,<br/>and discard any Heal Pots you're carrying so that you don't lose your equipment.

Zalokleft (6-8F) steals an inventory item, warps, then runs away - defeat it to reclaim the stolen item.<br/>Likewise, Froggo (6-7F) steals Gitan, warps, then runs away at double speed - defeat it to reclaim your money.<br/>In either case, if you defeat the monster before it steals from you, it'll drop an item or Gitan bag.

### Reckless Tunnel (7-8F)

Nigiri Morph (8-10F) has a special attack that transforms an inventory item into a Large Onigiri.<br/>This is fine if you didn't need the item, but it might target a pot filled with important items,<br/>so it's best to use projectiles and items to ensure it doesn't get a chance to act.

### Stone Fort Ruins (9-10F)

Boy Cart (9-10F) shoots Iron Arrows, and likes to maintain a set distance while inside rooms.<br/>It won't shoot arrows when it's in a hallway, so retreat into a hallway to safely defeat it.

Shadow Hat (9-10F) is always generated napping, and won't wake up unless you move next to it.<br/>Its special attack takes control of a target for a while, which has a similar effect to confusion<br/>where you can't move or attack in the direction you aim for.

Twisty Hani (10-12F) can perform a dance that decreases a target's level by 1.<br/>It's quite a problem if it does it multiple times in a row, so it's best to use projectiles or items.<br/>Despite the risk, it provides 200 experience points, so it's worth it to hunt them if you have lots of arrows.<br/>It's always generated napping, so ignoring it is also an option.

### Negoro Shrine

Shield base defense is extremely important in this game, so it's worth upgrading to an Iron Shield here.<br/>On the flip side, weapon strength isn't as impactful, so you can get by without a Katana if you're short on money.<br/><span class="strong">Buy 1 Antidote Grass and 3\~4 Otogiriso for synthesis, even if you have to sell other items to fund it.</span><br/>If you're low on food, buy 2\~3 Huge Onigiri - you need to be able to linger on upcoming Thief Pelican floors.

#### Inn

Pay 500 Gitan to fully restore HP and fullness.

#### Item Shop

|Item|Price|
|-|-|
|Nagamaki|700|
|Katana|1200|
|Bronze Shield|400|
|Iron Shield|1200|
|Huge Onigiri|300|

### Tenrin Forest (11-12F)

The map generation switches back to Shuffle type for a while, so field of view isn't limited.

Mutaikon (11-14F) throws Poison Grass, which lowers your strength by 1 and inflicts Slow status.<br/>The strength lowering effect can be blocked by a Scale Shield, or the う or 消 synthesis seals.<br/>It has a throwing range of 2 tiles, so you can use arrows from outside its range to defeat it.<br/>If you become adjacent or if there are other monsters nearby, use a staff or scroll.

Spike Dragon (12-14F) retreats into its shell after 4 turns, then floats for 2 turns before coming out of its shell.<br/>Its attack pattern changes to a 1 tile radius when it's inside its shell, so be careful where you stand.<br/>If it defeats a different monster and levels up into an Earth Needle (150 HP), it's best to run away.

### Shirakami Swamp (13-14F)

Thief Pelican (13-14F), the synthesis monster of this game, finally appears.<br/>To synthesize, simply throw a weapon or shield to use as a base at Thief Pelican, followed by a secondary item.<br/>It's very highly recommended to synthesize an Antidote Grass and 3 Otogiriso into your shield here.<br/>Lv1 Thief Pelicans can only eat up to 2 items, so you'll need 4 of them to finalize your shield.<br/>If you have Otogiriso left after the above, go ahead and synthesize some into your weapon.<br/><span class="strong">※ Thief Pelican can inhale an inventory item when it's adjacent to you, so keep your distance.</span>

#### Midpoint

An event featuring Heiji and Kihachi occurs when you advance past 13F for the first time.<br/>You have to choose one of them to join you as an ally to proceed - be sure to listen to their explanations.<br/>Heiji has higher stats than Kihachi at lower levels, so just choose him if you can't make up your mind.<br/>Allies only gain experience points when they deal the finishing blow in this game.

### King's Rock (15-16F)

A dungeon shop is almost always generated on 16F, so check it out before advancing.<br/>However, don't try to steal from the shop unless you know what you're doing, as it's likely to end your run.

### Kouga Village

There's nothing in this village aside from story scenes at this point in the game.<br/>Go ahead and enter Kouga Castle when you're ready.

### Kouga Castle (17-20F)

Scrolls are the only item category that can be found on the ground between 17-20F.<br/>Keep an eye out for Rockfall and Lightning scrolls to use during the upcoming boss fight.<br/>If you find a Plating Scroll, go ahead and use it on your shield.

Kengo (17-20F) can disarm your equipped shield, sending it flying behind you.<br/>The shield is permanently lost if it hits a character or lands on an air tile, so be very careful - don't dash.<br/>It's best to fight them with your back against a wall, and use a staff or scroll if you're not near a wall.

Demon Warrior (17-20F) reappears as Ghost Warrior after 3 turns pass once defeated.<br/>Ghost Warrior runs toward a different monster and levels them up - bad if it's a Kengo or Horse Samurai.<br/>It has 4 HP, but it only receives 1 damage from direct attacks and arrows, and it might warp when hit.<br/>Therefore, it's best to use fixed damage attacks such as Knockback Staff to one-shot it.

### Boss

Fight against Head Ninja and an assortment of other Kouga ninjas.

|Name|HP|Atk|Def|Exp|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Head Ninja|150|30|16|0|・Attacks in 3 forward directions.<br/>・Does a lunge attack to close the gap when lined up.<br/>・Warps and summons 3 Adept Ninjas after being hit when alone.|

His attacks sound a bit tricky, but the boss doesn't resist status conditions, so there are countless ways<br/>to have an easy fight - Confusion Scroll → Blaze Scroll combo, swing a Decoy Staff at the boss, etc.<br/>Sanctuary Scroll and Slumber Scroll are also effective against the boss.

If the other ninjas are giving you trouble, you can wipe them out using 2\~3 Rockfall or Lighting scrolls.<br/>Lightning Staff is another solid option, since they tend to group up.
