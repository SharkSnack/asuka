</div>

The 2nd dungeon of the game, and a decent bit harder than Tenrin Easy.<br/>Despite being a story dungeon, staves, pots, grass, and scrolls are found unidentified.<br/>That said, there's no limit to the number of items you can bring, so it's not all that difficult.

The 1st ending plays after clearing this dungeon, but don't be fooled - the story continues in a new region.<br/>There are plenty of new dungeons and gameplay mechanics to be enjoyed, so don't stop playing.<br/>If you revisit Kouga Village after clearing this dungeon, you'll be given a Synthesis Pot[5].

# Floor Guide

### Izayoi Paddy - South (1-2F)

Monsters are weak, so you shouldn't have problems - check every room and pick up all items.<br/>Lady Locks (2-4F) can reflect Minamo's kunai attack, so don't let Minamo roam around on her own.<br/>Remember, an ally has to land the final hit to gain experience points in this game.

### Morigami Underpass (3-4F)

Sluggy (3-4F) appears, so use arrows or staves if you don't have the う or 消 seal on your shield.<br/>It's hard to restore ally strength if they get licked, so consider taking the hit for them if they're facing a Sluggy.

### Jade Cave (5-6F)

Gazer (5-7F) and Nigiri Morph (6-8F) can destroy items.<br/>Use projectiles to safely defeat them from a distance, and use a staff or scroll if adjacent.

### Mountain Pass

Choose between Heiji and Kihachi to join you as an ally to proceed.<br/>If you want to focus on leveling Minamo, choose Kihachi and defeat him right away. (Heiji dodges arrows)

### Tenrin Forest - East (7-8F)

Thief Pelican (7-10F) can be used to synthesize items.<br/>Again, it's highly recommended to synthesize an Antidote Grass and 3 Otogiriso into your shield.<br/>Lv1 Thief Pelicans can only eat up to 2 items, so you'll need 4 of them to finalize your shield.<br/>Walrus Shield can be equipped to block Thief Pelican from inhaling items when adjacent.

Rocket Boar (7-9F) can make you trip and drop items, so fight with your back against a wall.<br/>If you found a Balance Staff, keep it in your inventory to prevent tripping.

### Shirakami Swamp - East (9-10F)

Bored Kappa (9-10F) throws items on the ground at you, so check rooms quickly.<br/>Leave 1 slot open in a Storage Pot to have a chance at catching an item thrown by a Bored Kappa.

Bitter Sluggy (9-11F) lowers max strength by 1, so avoid direct attacks unless you have う or 消 on your shield.<br/>If an ally gets licked, their strength will be lowered by 20%.

Demon Warrior (9-11F) reappears as Ghost Warrior after 3 turns pass once defeated.<br/>
Ghost Warrior runs toward a different monster and levels them up, so use a Knockback Staff to one-shot it.

Twisty Hani (10-12F) can perform a dance that decreases a target's level by 1.<br/>Allies attack napping monsters, so expect to fight Twisty Hanis if you have allies with you.<br/>Otherwise, they only wake up if you walk next to them, so they can be ignored.

### Fuigo Copper Mine (11-12F)

Curse Girl (12-14F) can curse 1 item, which generally makes the item unable to be unequipped, or unusable.<br/>Pots can't be cursed in this game, so protect important items by inserting them into pots.<br/>Purify Scroll can never be cursed, so it's safe to carry it outside of a pot.

Spin Polygon (12-14F) teleports to you inside rooms, which can be dangerous in a Monster House.<br/>If that happens, use a Swap Staff to escape into a hallway.

Mutaikon (12-14F) throws Poison Grass, which lowers your strength by 1 and inflicts Slow status.<br/>It has a throwing range of 2 tiles, so you can use arrows from outside its range to defeat it.

### Fire Dragon's Fangs (13-14F)

Falcon Tengu (11-13F) disguises itself as a different monster, and overlaps with Robber Pelican (13-16F) on 13F.<br/><span class="strong">Therefore, don't throw equipment right away at Robber Pelicans on 13F - shoot an arrow to check if it's real first.</span><br/>If you want to be extra safe, wait to synthesize until 14F where Falcon Tengu no longer appears.

### Ancient Tomb (15-16F)

Kengo (14-16F) can disarm your equipped shield, sending it flying behind you.<br/>The shield is permanently lost if it hits a character, so be careful - don't dash, and fight with a wall behind you.

Pop Tank (14-16F) fires cannonballs that deal a fixed 20 damage.<br/>The cannonball blasts deal damage in a 1 tile radius, so watch where you stand to avoid leveling it up.<br/>Water Pot can be used to inflict Sealed status, which prevents a monster from using its special attack.

### Yokai Village

A peculiar village full of friendly monsters - don't worry, you won't have to fight any of them.<br/>Stock up at the item shop if you're running low on food or healing items.

#### Inn

Pay 500 Gitan to fully restore HP and fullness.

#### Item Shop

|Item|Price|
|-|-|
|Dried Bonito|2000|
|Walrus Shield|6000|
|Huge Onigiri|300|
|Otogiriso|500|
|Antidote Grass|400|
|Purify Scroll|1000|
|Identify Scroll|500|
|Storage Pot[4]|1440|
|Heal Pot[4]|1200|
|Escape Scroll|1000|

### Hourai Cave (17-18F)

Dragon (17-20F) has high attack power, and can breathe fire that deals 20 damage in a straight line.<br/>Be careful where you stand if there are other monsters around so that it doesn't level up into a Sky Dragon.

King Tusker (17-20F) swings a Paralysis Staff, which is very dangerous if there are other monsters in the room.<br/>It's best to assume red dots outside of your view are King Tuskers in this floor range.

### Mount Hourai (19-20F)

Nigiri Boss (20-22F) inflicts Onigiri status, which nullifies equipment and prevents item usage for 10 turns.<br/>It's mostly fine if it's a 1 vs 1 fight, but it's extremely dangerous if other monsters are around.

Bandit Pelican (20-24F) acts at double speed, and can be rather annoying if you can't defeat it quickly.<br/>Thief Pelican types gain strength when they eat, so consider stepping away after they steal if your defense is low.<br/>If you want to synthesize, it's recommended to do so on 20F for terrain reasons.

If you're feeling adventurous, have Menbell (20-22F) summon monsters until you obtain a Minotaur's Axe.<br/>This axe can be synthesized into your main weapon to gain the 会 seal (1/4 chance to land a critical hit).<br/>However, be warned that monsters Menbell summons including Minotaur can be quite powerful.<br/>※ This can only be done between 20-21F, since Taurs don't appear on 22F.

### Water Dragon's Spine (21-22F)

Area where you utilize springs to change rooms instead of hallways.

Iai (22-24F) can disarm your equipped weapon or shield, sending it flying behind you.<br/>It has high attack power and defense, so don't hesitate to use items - Water Pot reduces its attack power.

### Meiouran (23-27F)

Super Gazer (23-25F) can hypnotize Asuka, making her use an item or attack in a random direction.<br/>If you're unlucky, it could make you read an Escape Scroll or insert your weapon or shield into a Heal Pot,<br/>so keep Escape Scroll inside a pot, and either discard any Heal Pots or keep your weapon and shield cursed.

Rancor Sluggy (24-27F) lowers max strength by 2 and multiplies, but you should have う or 消 on your shield<br/>at this point, so the main danger is an ally getting licked if you have allies with you.

Power type monsters like Minotaur, Chainhead, Nashagga, Sky Dragon, Cranky Tank appear between 25-27F.<br/>It's fine to trade hits if your shield is strong and you have lots of 弟 seals, but otherwise it's best to rush stairs.<br/>If you have Navigation Scrolls, go ahead and read them on these floors.

### Meiouran Peak

#### 1st Fight

Fight against the incomplete form of Meiouran.

|Name|HP|Atk|Def|Exp|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Meiouran|300|45|20|9999|・Eats projectiles to heal 20 HP.<br/>・Doesn't move or attack.<br/>・Closes its flower bud to become invulnerable.<br/>・Summons 1 monster while flower bud is open.|

Meiouran doesn't move or use direct attacks, but can close its flower bud to shield itself from damage.<br/>The flower bud loop: closed for 4 turns → opens flower bud → open for 6 turns → closes flower bud  → repeat.<br/>It's completely invulnerable while its flower bud is closed, so you have to wait until it opens up to deal damage.<br/>It can eat projectiles and thrown items to heal itself by 20 HP, and it summons 1 monster while its flower bud is open.

The fight begins with monsters on the field - 1 Sky Dragon, 2 Earth Needles, 2 Nashaggas, and 2 Horse Shoguns.<br/>The monsters it can summon include Nashagga, Horse Shogun, Skull Dragon, Rancor Sluggy, and Yenron.

There's distance between Asuka and monsters at the start, so Sky Dragon and Horse Shogun can be troublesome.<br/>Confusion Scroll seals their special attacks for 20 turns, and Swap Staff can be used to quickly get closer.<br/>Decoy Staff is rather risky, since Lv3 versions of any of the monsters in this fight are quite strong.<br/>Sanctuary Scroll cannot be used, so don't bother placing it on the ground.

#### 2nd Fight

Fight against the complete form of Meiouran.

|Name|HP|Atk|Def|Exp|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Meiouran|300|45|20|9999|・Doesn't move or attack.<br/>・Closes its flower bud to become invulnerable.<br/>・Summons 1 monster while flower bud is open.|
|Stamen|50|25|15|500|・Doesn't move.<br/>・2 tile radius attack that lowers strength by 1.|
|Vine|50|30|10|500|・Moves underfoot and launches Asuka away.|

Minamo joins you as an ally before this fight begins, even if she wasn't present for the 1st fight.<br/>If she was present for the 1st fight, her HP won't be restored, so use Heal Staff or Otogiriso on her.

Meiouran doesn't behave differently, other than not being able to eat projectiles and thrown items.<br/>Minamo's kunai attack and arrows are a nice source of damage, and the flower bud tile can be set on fire.<br/>Other monsters don't appear at the start of the fight, so it's easier to approach Meiouran.

The stamens don't move, but attack a 2 tile radius which lowers strength by 1 point after 3 turns.<br/>Vines approach Asuka, and will hit Asuka away from Meiouran if you don't move when they're underfoot.<br/>Decoy Staff can be used to make vines go after a different target, letting you focus on the boss.

Most story dungeons after this one don't allow carry-in items, so don't hesitate to use up your items.
