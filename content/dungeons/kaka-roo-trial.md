</div>

Dungeon where you make use of traps to progress, similar to Halfway Well in Shiren 2.<br/>Traps can be picked up, placed, and tossed at monsters so that they land underfoot and activate.

Weapons and shields are rare, and Thief Pelicans don't appear so synthesis is not possible.<br/>Strong enemies appear earlier than in most other dungeons, including Earth Needle from 12F.

One misplay can lead to a collapse, so players who rely on equipment a lot typically struggle.<br/>You could say it's a dungeon where player skill shines more than other dungeons.

### General

#### Story Clear (15F)

Weapons and shields are rare. Traps can make up for a lack of weapon, but defense remains a problem.<br/>A shield can't be upgraded even if you find one, so there's no avoiding high damage if a stronger monster hits you.<br/>In addition, single large room Monster Houses have a higher chance of being generated on 10\~13F.

Unlike Shiren 2's Halfway Well, Trapper status doesn't reduce the player's attack power.<br/>Therefore, arrows are an effective source of damage - stock up using Wood Arrow and Iron Arrow traps.<br/>Boy Cart (6-7F) can be used to collect a stack of 99 Iron Arrows, which should last until the end.<br/>If you have arrows and find a Scout or Phantasm bracelet, you'll have an even easier time.

#### Full Version (50F)

50F sounds easy, but end game enemies appear, including floors where Archdragon and Devil Kangaroo overlap.<br/>The key is to use Scout and Phantasm bracelets to evade enemies, but Vision Bracelet can't be found,<br/>so Ether Devil types are a major threat - Use Pitfalls and Navigation Scrolls from 40F to avoid Astral Devils.

The number of Storage Pots you find greatly impacts difficulty, since this pot lets you carry more traps.<br/>Make enemies trip early game to stock up on Storage Pots, and use Trap Scrolls to search for Trip Stones.<br/>Blast Hammer is basically the helper item for those that struggle to clear the dungeon.

### Equipment / Items

#### Weapon / Shield

##### Story Clear

Mallet has pretty reliable attack power compared to other options.<br/>Pickaxe + Leather Shield or Bowl Shield is also decent, or Bronze Shield if you can't find anything better.<br/>Avoid equipping Steady Shield since it doubles your hunger rate, and discard Clubs.<br/>Worst case, you can still reach 15F without any equipment.

#### Staves

Try to keep Tunnel, Swap, and Knockback staves on hand at all times. (2\~3 if aiming for 50F)<br/>Tunnel Staff is used to misdirect monsters, and Knockback is used with Swap Staff to evade enemies.<br/>Pull Staff isn't essential, but is nice for stealing from a shop or relocating traps.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Traps

Traps can be picked up and thrown - Unlike some other games, placing traps consumes your turn.<br/>Thrown traps activate when they land on the ground, and will land underfoot if thrown at an enemy.<br/>Floating monsters can move over traps without activating them, but thrown traps are still effective.

#### Explanations

Landmine and Spoil Trap are fantastic, but if you only use the most useful traps, you'll quickly run out.<br/>So it's important to be able to utilize all traps, while taking break chance into account.

- Multiply (10F+)
    - Restock traps, similar to a Trap Scroll.
    - Avoid carrying more than 3 of these, since you need inventory space for other traps too.
- Pitfall (10F+)
    - Skip to the next floor. (Doesn't work between 14-15F)
    - Extremely rare, but essential for Astral Devil (40F+) floors if aiming for the 2nd clear.
    - If you're adjacent to a wall, throw it at the wall to activate it underfoot in 1 turn.
- Landmine (4F+), Big Landmine (6F+)
    - Capable of instantly defeating multiple enemies in one activation.
    - Also used to obtain Grilled Onigiri, but has a high chance to break after activation.
    - Effective against Ether Devil types, so try to keep 4\~5 on hand.
- Spoil (3F+)
    - Instantly defeats a monster by turning them into a Spoiled Onigiri.
    - Use this as your main offensive trap if you have lots of Storage Pots.<br/>If inventory space is limited, mix in Curse, Slow, Strip, and Poison Arrow traps.
- Strip (6F+)
    - Seals a monster, preventing the use of their special attack and disabling any abilities.
    - 10% chance to break means it typically lasts a long time, and it's best to set it in a hallway.
    - Purify Scroll can't be found, so this trap is the only way to unequip cursed equipment.
- Poison Arrow (1F+)
    - Reduces a monster's strength to 0, and plays well with Strip Trap.
    - Can be used with Bowl Shield to replenish fullness.
    - Poison arrows shot from your inventory deal a fixed 10 damage and lower strength by 20%,<br/>so consider stocking some once you're near Cave Mamel (26-29F) floors.
- Curse (5F+)
    - Inflicts Blind status on a monster, and has a 15% chance to break.
    - Have monsters defeat each other to level up for lots of experience points,<br/>place it near the entrance of a Monster House to thin out monsters, etc.
- Slow (1F+)
    - This appears from 1F, so it's often used early game to conserve better traps.<br/>Recommended to place it in a hallway if possible.
- Spring (1F+)
    - Keep 1~2 on hand for emergencies, even if you have a Warp Bracelet.
    - Postponing a strong monster is quite valuable, and Asuka can warp without RNG being a factor.
- Sleep (1F+)
    - Puts a monster to sleep for 5 turns.
    - It's effective, but has the same break chance as Spoil Trap, so prioritize the latter.
- Spin (1F+)
    - Inflicts Confused status on a monster, which isn't that great of a status condition.
    - This appears from 1F, so it's often used early game to conserve better traps.
    - Can be used with Bear and One-Way traps to create a Cave Mamel on 1-2F.
- Trip (1F+)
    - Makes a monster trip and drop an item, and has a pretty low chance of being generated.
    - Utilize it until it breaks early game - Use Summon and Monster traps to spawn more monsters.
- Wood Arrow (1F+), Iron Arrow (5F+)
    - Arrows are usually collected from Boy Cart (6-7F) instead of traps, but can be nice early game.<br/>Wood Arrow Trap has a low 5% chance to break, so it's easy to stock up.
- Rockslide (4F+), Zap (10F+)
    - Decent power during early game, but high chance to break.
    - Zap Trap might be useful for small Monster Houses, but it's not worth carrying around.
- Rust (6F+)
    - Reduces a monster's defense to 0, and one-shots Inferno (12-15F).
    - More effective from mid game onward, but it's not worth carrying around.
- Bear (1F+)
    - Prevents a monster from moving for 8 turns.
    - Shoot arrows or attack the monster from a distance using an Ironhead's Head.
    - If you have a Phantasm Bracelet, place it near a hallway corner to safely defeat enemies.
- One-Way (1F+)
    - Mostly useless on its own, but can be placed in a hallway with another trap to form a chain.
    - The arrow direction is based on the direction Asuka is facing when the trap is placed.
- Rage (8F+)
    - Place it in a spot where monsters won't step on it, and use it to buff Asuka's attack power.
- Droplet (6F+), Burr (1F+), Spike (5F+), Log (1F+), Rockfall (2F+)
    - Not very useful - Place them in hallways to soften monsters up a bit, but that's about it.
    - Log Trap can be used to escape from a Monster House, or steal from a shop on a water floor.
    - Be warned that Rancor Sluggy (16-23F) and Venom Sluggy (27-38F) will multiply from the damage.
- Monster (8F+), Summon (1F+)
    - Use these alongside a Trip Stone to collect items from monsters.
    - Consider destroying them using Mallet, Water Pot, or Pierce Bracelet if you don't need them.
- Alert (8F+)
    - Undesirable, but can be handy to wake up monsters while collecting items with a Trip Stone.

# Floor Guide

### 1-2F

Recommended to bring Strange Onigiri and Koyori's Onigiri into the dungeon.<br/>
※ Strange Onigiri is unlocked by staying overnight at [Gokoku Valley](/dungeons/bufu-trial)'s inn with Minamo in your party.

Early game becomes much easier if you level up a Pit Mamel (1-2F) into a Cave Mamel and defeat it.<br/>Have Pit Mamel and Mamel follow you into a hallway, and toss a Spin Trap at the Pit Mamel in a hallway bend.<br/>This ensures Mamel won't run away, and Pit Mamel is free to attack it.

Shops can be generated on 1-2F, so keep an eye out for Blast Hammer if you find a shop.<br/>You likely won't be able to afford it this early in the dungeon, so you'll usually have to steal it instead.<br/>Use Tunnel or Pull staves, wait until the wind blows so you can see the locations of enemies, etc.<br/>※ Spoil Traps are never generated on 1-2F, so be careful not to starve.
